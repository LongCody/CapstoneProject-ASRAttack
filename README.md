# CapstoneProject-ASRAttack
Our ASR Attack project aims to create Adversarial Examples (AE) which can be injected during an auditory command given to these smart voice devices and cause it to misclassify the given command. This is started by creating a model that would first translate audio files to make sure the correct input is received into the ASR, then noise will be added to the audio files until the ASR has a misclassified command. From here the team created the AEâ€™s using the Kenansville Attack as a base and adding additional attacks to be used in further real-world attacks on the system. To deliver the attacks, the team is using a Raspberry Pi device to listen for the trigger phrase and play the AE. The ASR device will then receive the user input and misclassify the command.

Execute python script

Run the .py file using the following command:

where:

# GUI

audio_file_path - full path to the audio file

outputfile - full path to the outputfile or outfile name (if you want it in the same location as the input file)

attack - fft, ssa, dct, or overlay
